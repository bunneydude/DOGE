Intel Cloud Analytics setup:

Make sure you enter your credentials in the intel_credentials.txt file in this format:

username="<your Intel IoT Cloud account username>"
password="<your Intel IoT Cloud account password>"
account_name="<your Intel IoT Cloud account name>"
device_id=""
device_token=""
 

You can leave the device_id and device_token fields empty and the script will create
a device  called Edison_DOGE and create a unique device token that can be used for the cloud API
