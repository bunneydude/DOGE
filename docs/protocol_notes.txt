The current protocol is variable width and is broken down into four groups: command, size, payload, and checksum.

There are only five commands: read, write, ack, nack, and nop. The payload consists of between 0 and 2 operands, depending on the command.

Command
READ: Read the memory located at the address in operand 1
	Operand 1 = source address

WRITE: Write the data to the address specified
	Operand 1: destination address
	Operand 2: write data

ACK: Send this command to signal an acknowledgement.
	No operands

NACK: Send this command to signal a negative-acknowledgement along with an error code
	Operand 1: error code

NOP: This command does nothing. It is mostly used in debug.

The size of a packet is equal to the number of operands. The checksum is the sum of the command, size, and operands (if any) modulo 256, times negative 1. A packet is considered valid if the sum of all four groups add to 0.
